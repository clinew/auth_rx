Auth Redux Mod v2.13
By Leslie Krause

Auth Redux is a drop-in replacement for the builtin authentication handler of Minetest.
It is designed from the ground up to be robust and secure enough for use on high-traffic
Minetest servers, while also addressing a number of outstanding bugs (including #5334 
and #6783 and #4451) in the Minetest 0.4.x engine.

Auth Redux is intended to be compatible with all versions of Minetest 0.4.14+.
